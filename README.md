# pyr-pricing
trying a fun side project on my own

going to try and scrape https://vulcandexstats.com/lavapyr

want to place it all into a nice chart using the new chart.js website api that i found

also will need to use local storage? for each time i load the page and maybe click to load the lava/pyr price
